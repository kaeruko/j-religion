        From Divine Possession to De-possession

    <p>
        The author, a psychiatrist, shares their experience of preventing a patient from establishing a religious organization with themselves as the deity during the course of psychological therapy.
    </p>
        <h2>Local and Family History</h2>

    <p>
        Between 1976 and 1978, I was involved in psychiatric care in the central region of Nara Prefecture (Kashihara). Even today, divine possession is not uncommon in the Kinki region. I was particularly struck by the numerous living gods this area produced, especially from Mount Ikoma to Miwa Shrine. Additionally, from Yamato to southern Osaka, divine possessions are prevalent, while from Yoshino to Mie, possession states and shared delusional disorders are observed.
    </p>
       
    <p>
        Among the cases of divine possession treated at the university hospital, I will report on a case where a passive and inferior younger brother resonated with the "delusions" of his strong-willed and superior older sister. This case reached the brink of forming a religious sect but ultimately did not. Although it cannot be said that our treatment caused this failure, it played a role. Encountering such "living gods" made me realize that the world in which Nakayama Miki, the founder of Tenrikyo, lived, although different in time and circumstance, was not so distant from our own.
    </p>
<p>
    The place where the sister and brother grew up, as well as the setting of the story, is located in the gentle hills of the western Nara Basin. This area is known for its agriculture and thriving cottage industry of sock manufacturing. At that time, it was gradually being incorporated into the commuting zone of Osaka. From 1968, hills were being cut down to build a new town, and the population growth rate was as high as 156 percent over the five years from 1970 to 1975. A toll highway was also opened in 1969, running east to west. The family home is located in an old Yamato village of about 20 households. In other words, it was a rural area near a major city, similar to the social conditions of the late Edo to Meiji period when popular religions were formed. A hundred years ago, it was a prosperous rural area with a developed commodity economy, and by 1976, it was rapidly being swallowed by urbanization, with old and new coexisting.
</p>
<p>
    The sister’s child was 36 years old, and her brother, S, was 34. Their two older brothers, aged 43 and 41, were married, and the younger brother was also married with two children. Their father, who was involved in agriculture, died of a stroke in 1956. The mother lived with the eldest son's family, who continued farming while also working for a company. She was devout from a young age and, although she doubted whether her daughter was being deceived by the religious leader, she supported Yoko until she fell into a state of confusion. The second son was involved in sock manufacturing and was more devout than the eldest son, becoming central to resolving the situation.
</p>
<p>
        Yoko was stubborn and strong-willed, dealing with matters proactively. Despite being the only girl among four siblings, she had a strong sense of not wanting to trouble her brothers. She had a personality that did not confide her troubles or worries to others.
        
        The younger brother was shy and sensitive, unable to speak out against things he disliked. He believed that suppressing his own feelings would improve situations. Among the family, the bond between the sister and brother was strong; the assertive sister cherished her dear brother, and their mother supported both of them.
    </p>
<p>
    In 1956, when Yoko was 16, their father passed away. She graduated from the local high school and helped with household chores while attending a dressmaking school for a while. At 21, she had an arranged marriage, which she reluctantly agreed to. Her husband used stimulants, went out at night, and had affairs, so she returned home in less than six months and divorced the following year. She disliked returning to her small village of about 20 households, so she stayed with relatives in Osaka and worked for two years. Feeling uncomfortable and out of place, she then moved to Kyoto, where she worked for another two years. After that, she returned home and helped with her second brother's sock manufacturing business. During this period, there were several talks of remarriage, but none materialized.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, her family maintained a small shrine. Her uncle had built a dojo near Nikoori Pond in the early Showa period and enshrined the Nikoori Pond Water God. According to legend, a water deity—a dragon god—resided in Nikoori Pond, and young women were once sacrificed as human pillars. The Nikoori Pond Water God was a branch of the Miwa Daijin Shrine, as were many in the area. Her uncle, who had remained unmarried, died in 1955, and her mother took over the shrine. The devout mother hoped someone would continue the shrine's upkeep.
</p>
<p>
In 1967, when Yoko was 27, a male relative borrowed land from her mother to build a small glass factory. For the ground-breaking ceremony, a shaman named T from Sakai City came to purify the site. He told the mother, "This house has a fate; a vengeful spirit is attached to it," and regarding the daughter who had returned after a divorce, "It’s because of this fate, and if she remarries, someone in this house will die." He further declared, "She should serve as a shrine maiden, or else she will not survive." Troubled by her daughter's divorce and the family's illnesses, and having long wondered who would take over the abandoned dojo by Nikoori Pond, the mother was influenced by T's words.
</p>
<p>
T ran a restaurant in Sakai and had established a religion called Shirotama Daijin and Shirotenryuo. He reportedly had about 50 followers. He was eloquent, intelligent, and, according to the eldest brother's wife, "a pompous person." He was married, had four children, and was 42 years old.
Initially, Yoko was indifferent to faith, but she began to see the leader T's words as "fate" and gradually aligned with her mother's wishes.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the younger brother, S, graduated from a local evening high school in 1962 and helped with the family's sock manufacturing and farming business. Encouraged by his sister, they began visiting the religious leader together every other day. Soon after, the leader introduced him to a job at a wholesale store run by another follower, where he also began participating in missionary activities. Before long, the leader, Yoko, and S decided to rebuild the shrine for the Nikoori Pond Water God, and it was completed in 1968.
</p>
<p>
Initially, the second brother supported the leader T taking over the Nikoori Pond Water God, but about a year and a half later, he began to distrust T, suspecting him of being a "shaman for profit rather than genuine worship." He started advocating for "just allowing us to have faith in our hearts." Around 1970, Yoko and the leader entered a common-law relationship. Although the brothers did not speak openly about it, they distanced themselves from the religious activities. Yoko tried to sever ties with the leader several times, but he warned her, "If you do not follow the path of the gods, you will die. If you leave me, you will either get tuberculosis or go mad. Your family will not continue. You are not fit for marriage, and if you remarry, your husband will die." Thus, she reluctantly continued to follow him. The eldest brother criticized her, saying, "Are you going to become a shrine maiden at such a young age?" Yoko rebelled against this, while their mother, despite saying, "We were deceived by the leader," secretly continued to support her daughter and son.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Yoko strengthened her bond with her brother and mother without consulting her brothers. She moved out of the house and began living alone while doing dressmaking. Her mother would occasionally visit her. In 1971, her brother S got married and, on the leader's recommendation, opened an okonomiyaki restaurant. Their first son was born the following year, and a daughter in 1974. Living near the leader's house, he also took on the role of driving the leader around. In February 1975, at the leader's suggestion, the Nikoori Pond Water God was merged with the leader's Shiratama Daijin and Shirotenryuo to form the "Nittenkyo." The leader appointed S as the Osaka branch manager, for which he rented an apartment in Osaka. However, T had to undergo surgery for gastric cancer, and Yoko took care of him. She once again consulted her brother about leaving T. Reflecting on this period, Yoko said, "I thought about living apart from the leader and getting married, but I couldn't make up my mind because of the gods."
</p>
<p>
Her brother also commented, "I grew tired of using the gods as a means to make money and decided to quit." Nittenkyo promoted the idea that the divine light would cleanse the spirits and demons residing in one's body, charging membership fees and light fees of 35,000 yen for beginners, 50,000 yen for intermediate, and 65,000 yen for advanced levels. However, he said, "The year after I quit was extremely stressful." Early in 1976, a fire broke out next door, and his house was damaged by water. This incident led the landlord to demand their eviction, prompting him to file a lawsuit alone. Additionally, their four-year-old child had difficulty speaking and had to be placed in an institution, adding to their troubles.

Once again, the leader was hospitalized, and Yoko visited the hospital daily, caring for him alongside his wife. On August 24, the leader passed away.
</p>
<p>

<h2>The Sister's Divine Possession</h2>

<p>
After the death of the religious leader, Yoko felt a bit down but reassured her sister-in-law by saying, "Don't worry. I have received the role from the gods, so I'll manage on my own." Believing she had to carry on the legacy left by the leader, Yoko couldn't take down the sign as followers continued to come to her for consultations. Her brother was willing to support her if she had divine power, but he was initially skeptical. Thirty-five days after the leader's death, Yoko mentioned, "I am starting to understand people's personalities. Strangely, things are happening just as I say."
</p>
<p>
On December 5, one hundred days after the leader's death, Yoko went to clean the shrine for the first time and offered a prayer. Suddenly, she began to dance, feeling that the spirit of the dragon god had possessed her, which delighted both Yoko and her brother. They had been questioning why a leader supposedly possessed by a god had suffered and died from cancer. They received a divine message: "The leader died that way because he went against the will of the gods." Yoko and her brother decided to pursue their path, different from the leader's methods.
</p>
<p>
On February 10, Yoko received a divine message in her chest: "Although you are in a human body, you are a transformation of the dragon." She began speaking the words of the gods. On the 13th, she visited a follower alone, made mistakes in the prayers, and felt unqualified to perform the rituals. On her way back, she suddenly started dancing in front of the station. Describing this pathologically, Yoko entered a state of confusion characterized by mental agitation, restlessness, divine possession, hyperactivity, excessive speech, and insomnia.
</p>
<p>
That night, Yoko made her brother drive her, saying, "I want to go to the sea and die," "Take me to a sacred place," and "I want to stand under a waterfall." They drove around the Kinki region from that night until the next day. As she said, "If you go against me, I will die," her brother complied with her requests. On the morning of the 15th, they returned to her brother's house, but Yoko insisted, "If I stay in the house, spirits will possess me and defile the place. Help me by letting me stay in the car." Taking her brother's wife and children, they continued driving. After going to Wakayama, they returned home in the evening, dropped off the wife and children, and then the two of them drove to Nikoori Pond.
</p>
<p>

At Nikoori Pond, Yoko refused to enter the shrine, saying she would be defiled. Her brother tried to rid her of the spirit by attempting to push her into the pond. Yoko, thinking the leader's spirit had possessed her brother, brandished a knife to ward off the demon. This led the brother into a delusional state as well. Afterwards, they returned to their family home, where Yoko was cared for by her eldest brother and his family. 
</p>
<p>

At home, Yoko alternated between praying and suddenly dancing. She would mutter, "Dragon god, help me," or "Brother, sister-in-law, my body hurts," and then suddenly grab her sister-in-law's chest, screaming, "I hate you, I'll kill you." She suffered from insomnia and refused to eat. On the 18th, possessed by the gods, she became agitated, threatening to burn down the house and destroy the entire family. At 3 AM on the 19th, she tried to topple an oil stove to set the house on fire. She resisted her family's attempts to stop her, and when she tried to break a window, her brother scolded her harshly. She apologized, saying, "Forgive me," displaying emotional instability. The family, believing she was possessed by a beast, spent the night chanting sutras to exorcise the spirit. On the morning of the 19th, she was taken to the hospital by ambulance and admitted.
</p>
<p>
Her brother returned home and went to work on the 16th but began hearing voices in the evening. Though unclear whose voices they were, they told him to "go to Tokyo" and "visit the Diet." He told his wife, "I'm going to Tokyo to save the children. I'll be gone for a few days, but I'll definitely come back." He then drove on the highway to Tokyo late at night. Upon arriving, he prayed for his child's recovery and asked that they become a prominent figure (like a Diet member). He quickly returned home but felt his chest tightening, as if his blood vessels were being crushed, believing he was possessed by an evil spirit. He mentioned stopping at a hospital for an IV, though this is uncertain. He sent a telegram from Yokaichi to his eldest brother’s house saying, "I was saved by the gods when I was about to die."
</p>
<p>

On the 18th at 3 PM, he returned to Sakai, drove his car onto a pile of sand at a construction site, and was found swimming in a puddle by the police, who took him into custody. He had dinner at his wife's family home but then ran out in his underwear, saying he had to "fight the evil spirit," and was found collapsed in a field. He had tried to kill himself by hitting his head on a stone to escape the torment. After having his forehead stitched at the hospital, he returned to his family home on the evening of the 19th. That night, he shouted, "What more do you want from us?" "Why do you still haunt us after death?" and "I must burn down that man's house." From 9 PM until the next morning, he mimicked the voices of himself, the leader, and his sister, performing loudly.

T: "What are you doing, having a physical relationship with Yoko?"
The spirit of the leader: "I'm sorry."
Sister Yoko: "How could you do such a terrible thing to me?"
T: "That's not enough of an apology..."

He continued his aggressive words towards the leader, claiming, "The leader is right in front of me," and "I can hear Yoko and the leader fighting." Thus, on the morning of the 20th, the day after Yoko was admitted, the brother was also admitted to the hospital.

While hospitalized, he said, "This morning, I fought the evil spirit and finally won. From the 16th to the 19th, the spirit crushed my blood vessels and strangled me, so I couldn't sleep or eat. Not being able to sleep wasn't the hard part. My eyes would suddenly flash with light. Even when I tried to sleep, the spirit would force my eyes open. I opposed my sister's faith. That's why this grudge occurred. I could hear the leader's voice saying, 'Thanks to me, you got your shop. If you don't do as I say, I'll strangle you to death.' Also, 'I was shocked when I saw it had possessed my sister and failed to remove it. Then it started whispering in my ear and possessed me. My eyes were pulled up, and I could hear voices in my ears. It was terrifying.'"

He described oscillating between a strong fear of the leader and aggressive feelings towards him.

<h2> Post-Hospitalization: From Divine Possession to Recovery</h2>

Yoko and her brother S were hospitalized for about two months from the end of December 1976. They calmed down and were discharged. Let's describe what they talked about during these two months (focusing on Yoko) in three parts: the progression of their confused state, their faith and social views, and the presence of the divine.

<h3> The Progression of Their Confused State</h3>

For the first week after being admitted, Yoko kept her eyes closed, her expression stiff, seemingly shut off in her inner world. She intermittently said things like, "The house has burned down completely, including my birthplace. My brother and eldest brother are pitiful. I am alone, and it's fine to be naked. Somehow, a fire started naturally." These words reflected her fantasies of hellfire and destruction. She attributed this to, "I was cursed by men. I was driven mad by spirits. I will take the blame myself. My brother is driven mad because he is concerned about me," hinting at the complex relationship with the leader or her divorce complex.

Later, she opened her eyes and said, "I was in a daze, but I was happy to receive medicine, be taken to the bath, and have meals prepared for me. It's the first time in my life that I have been taken care of so much. Everyone told me to open my eyes, but I was scared they would spin. Being alone like this is the ultimate happiness. It's a state of emptiness," and, "I want to leave the past behind and start over. I want to stay in the hospital for a while longer." She revealed that by keeping her eyes tightly shut, she endured the confusion, saying, "If I let my ego out, I would go mad."

Regarding her experience of divine possession, she said, "No matter where I went, it was good at first, but then I was treated as a nuisance. It was nothing but hardship," and, "When I was in middle school, the heavenly god chose me. It was the leader's god's prophecy," attributing meaning to her past. This shows that one does not suddenly become a god; the influence of preceding religious figures, often playing a negative role, is crucial.

<h3>Faith and Social Views</h3>

She expressed no regrets towards the leader, saying, "I nursed him sincerely until the very end. His wife was like a sister to me. My brother and I trusted the leader, so we don't feel betrayed. The deceased leader is concerned about us and hasn't found peace. His spirit hasn't settled, which is why it possessed my brother and tried to kill me. I swung the knife to ward off the demon. I want to perform memorial services so his spirit can be at peace."

She also mentioned, "A year before the leader passed away, I thought about living alone and getting married if I found the right person, but I couldn't because of the god. I felt I had to take over Nikoori Pond, and I came with a sense of resignation. Now that things have turned out this way, I want to change my way of life. I want to walk the path of a woman and find happiness, but it's not easy to sort out my feelings." Despite this, she continued, "I couldn't sever my relationship with the leader. I took care of all his belongings, including his clothes. It was all hard work. I don't hold a grudge, but it was a trial. I didn't tell my siblings, but the heavenly god sees everything."

<h3>The Presence of the Divine</h3>

Reflecting on the confusion after the leader's death, she said, "Until now, I prayed to the leader, and I was an ordinary person. I always intended to maintain the church as the second leader, but I was very anxious about doing it alone. I was troubled by the conflict between me, my mother, my brother, and my two older brothers," showing she had been trying to make sense of her experiences and the divine presence.

In conclusion, their two-month hospitalization marked a significant turning point. Yoko and her brother started to regain clarity and attempted to reconcile their tumultuous experiences with their faith and the societal expectations placed upon them.</p>
